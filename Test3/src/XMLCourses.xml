    <title>Intro to Lean Manufacturing</title>
    <description>Lean manufacturing is emerging globally as a paradigm by which business units function to be globally competitive. Quality, cost, and delivery have become critical measures that impact profits, and, in turn, the success of an organization. Significant improvements in these measures come from the continuous elimination of waste, or non-value added activities, in manufacturing. This course is intended to familiarize students with this new philosophy of lean manufacturing and arm them with a basic toolset that enables the identification, measurement, and elimination of non-value added activities.</description>
